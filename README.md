# modhis_polarimetry_feasibility_study
A repository to keep files related to the modhis polarimetry feasibility study. 

The primary goals of the feasibility study are to:
- Evaluate possible instrument configurations that enable polarimetry (work led by Dan Reilly at COO)
- Develop instrumental Mueller Matrices
- Develop mock observation sequences, coupled to exposure time calculations, to evaluate whether these initial designs can achieve the science goals.
   - Evaluate the biases introduced by double differencing with long-exposures (5-10mins). Pick three declinations, pick three hour angle start times (for each declination)
   - Do derivatives of system with respect to the calibration terms that we need to know.
