# modhis_polarimetry_feasibility_study
A repository to keep files related to the modhis polarimetry feasibility study. 

The primary goals of the feasibility study are to:
- Evaluate possible instrument configurations that enable polarimetry (work led by Dan Reilly at COO)
- Develop instrumental Mueller Matrices
- Develop mock observation sequences, coupled to exposure time calculations, to evaluate whether these initial designs can achieve the science goals.
